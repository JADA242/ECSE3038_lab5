# ESP32 API 

## Summary
This project demonstrates how an ESP32 connects to a Wi-Fi network, sends a GET request to an API endpoint, and displays the response on a 16x2 LCD. 

## Key Functions

### `spinner()`
Displays a rotating spinner on the LCD during Wi-Fi connection.

### `setup()`
Sets up serial communication, LCD, and Wi-Fi connection, displaying messages on the LCD.

### `loop()`
Makes repeated GET requests to the API, parses the JSON response, and displays the message on the LCD.

## Purpose
The code was written as part of an IOT lab assignment to demonstrate the process of APIs using embedded systems, focusing on Wi-Fi connectivity, HTTP requests, and JSON parsing.

## Riddle
The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?
